# CSCI-400-Cloud-Computing

The application allows the user to log in 
with their Google account and enter a prime 
number. We tried to get 
the number stored in memcache. There was 
a plan to cron job a variable related 
to either the prime validations or 
server time, but the only cron job
is at /cronjob.

AppEngine web services:
-Google User Management
-Memcache
-Cron jobs
